## Introduction
The "Harmonic Complexifier" is a web-developed software that allows the user to add up to 5 level of complexity to a commonly structured 4-chords sequence, given as input. 
The main idea of this project was to develop a software application enabling inexperienced musicians to generate intricate and dynamically evolving chord sequences. This would be accomplished by using specific musical rules and substitutions, which will be discussed in detail later.

## Features
> - 
> - preset selection, allowing the user for a quicker input by giving only a root and a sequence
> - level of complexity selection
> - play the chord sequence, to compare the obtained result with the input
> - 2 different playing patterns: Strummed and Finger-Picked
> - 3 levels of playback speed
> - guitar tablature for the outputted chords
> - midi file export of the "complexified" sequence
